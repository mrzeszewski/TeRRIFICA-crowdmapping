## About TeRRIFICA

Starting on January 2019 and with duration of three and a half years, the TeRRIFICA project set up tailored roadmaps and key performance indicators for the implementation of the developed methodologies and climate change adaptation and mitigation activities in regional practice. Customised capacity building for the different stakeholder groups was be offered.

Through workshops and regional and international summer schools, TeRRIFICA aimed to empower local people, with a particular focus on regional authorities and policy makers, and developed adequate solutions together with them. Field trips to local and regional promising activities related to research and regional innovation, and broader stakeholder engagement with feedback loops were organised.

Through its co-creative multi-stakeholder approaches, participants had the opportunity to expand their knowledge around climate change and innovative climate action and to identify opportunities, drivers and barriers of implementation. Activities take into account challenges for the acceptance and feasibility, technological and regulatory constraints in six pilot regions.
